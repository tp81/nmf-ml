nmf-ml
======

Multi-layer non-negative matrix factorization MATLAB implementation.

The algorithm is described in ["Efficient Blind Spectral Unmixing of Fluorescently Labeled Samples Using Multi-Layer Non-Negative Matrix Factorization"][1]. You are free to use the code. Please acknowledge by citing.

To install, clone (git clone https://github.com/tp81/nmf-ml.git) into a new directory. You can test it in MATLAB by changing to that directory and running basic_test.m, which also shows a basic use case.

Enjoy!
