You are free to use the code. Please acknowledge by citing.\r\n\r\nTo install, clone (git clone https://github.com/tp81/nmf-ml.git) into a new directory. You can test it in MATLAB by changing to that directory and running basic_test.m, which also shows a basic use case.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n[Thomas Pengo][0]\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://thomaspengo.org/themes/thomas/logo.png \"Thomas Pengo\")\r\n\r\n[0]: http://thomaspengo.org\r\n[1]: http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0078504\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
